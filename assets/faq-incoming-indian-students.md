# NU Sanskriti: The Complete Guide for Indian Students (Updated)

### Namaste and a very warm welcome to the Husky Family!

Moving to a new country is a huge step, filled with excitement and a few challenges. We at **NU Sanskriti**, the Indian student association at Northeastern, have all been there. This guide is our way of paying it forward—a collection of our experiences, tips, and tricks to help make your journey to Boston as smooth as possible.

> **A Friendly Disclaimer:** This guide is based on the collective experiences of students and is intended as a helpful starting point. Information like prices, policies, and official procedures can change. **It is your responsibility to verify all official details** with the university (OGS, NUPD, etc.), banks, government websites, and other service providers. Think of us as friendly seniors giving advice, but always do your own research to confirm the facts!

### **TL;DR: The Absolute Essentials**

For those in a hurry, here are the most critical things to remember:

* **Documents:** Keep your I-20, Passport (with Visa), and NU Admission Letter in your carry-on bag at all times. Have digital copies on your phone/cloud storage.
* **Arrival:** Land at Boston Logan Airport (BOS). The easiest way to your apartment is an **Uber/Lyft**. The cheapest way is the **free Silver Line (SL1) bus**.
* **Housing:** **NEVER** pay a deposit or sign a lease for an off-campus apartment without seeing it (or having a trusted friend do a video tour) and having the lease reviewed for free by **NU's Off-Campus Student Services (OCSS)**. Housing scams are very common.
* **Scams:** Government agencies (like USCIS, IRS, or the FBI) will **NEVER** call you to threaten deportation or demand immediate payment via gift cards or wire transfer. Hang up on such calls immediately—they are scams.
* **Academics:** Understand the strict rules on **Academic Integrity and Plagiarism**. Copying from any source without proper citation can have severe consequences. When in doubt, ask your professor.

## **Phase 1: Pre-Departure Checklist (Back in India)**

This is the planning stage. Ticking these off will save you a lot of stress later.

* [ ] **Book Your Flights:** Use student-focused sites like StudentUniverse or check for student discounts on airline websites. Book as early as possible for better prices.
* [ ] **Document Prep:**
    * [ ] Get your I-20, passport, and US visa ready.
    * [ ] Keep your NU admission letter and SEVIS fee receipt handy.
    * [ ] Gather all original academic transcripts and degree certificates.
    * [ ] Get your medical records and vaccination certificates (especially for Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Tetanus, as required by the university).
* [ ] **Create a "Ready-Access" Folder:** Keep physical and digital copies (on Google Drive/Dropbox) of all the above documents. You will need these for immigration at the airport.
* [ ] **Financial Prep:**
    * [ ] Inform your Indian bank (e.g., HDFC, ICICI) about your international travel to enable your debit/credit cards.
    * [ ] Arrange for US currency. Carrying around $500 - $700 in cash is generally a good idea for immediate expenses. A Forex card is a great, secure option for larger amounts.
* [ ] **Connect with the Community:** Join official NU Sanskriti and other incoming student WhatsApp groups. This is the best place for real-time updates, finding roommates, and asking questions.
* [ ] **Initial Housing Research:** Start looking at Boston neighborhoods online. Use the resources in the [Housing Section](#deep-dive-housing-in-boston) of this guide. **Do not sign a lease or pay a deposit without getting it reviewed by NU's Off-Campus Student Services (OCSS)!**

## **Phase 2: The Art of Packing**

Boston has four distinct seasons, with hot, humid summers and very cold, snowy winters. Pack smart, not heavy. You can buy almost everything here, but some things are good to bring from home.

**Must-Haves (Carry-On Bag):**
* Your "Ready-Access" folder with all essential documents.
* Laptop, phone, chargers, and a universal power adapter.
* A power bank.
* Any prescription medication (with a doctor's prescription note) for a few weeks.
* A change of clothes.
* Some US dollars.

**Checked Luggage Checklist:**
* [ ] **Clothing:**
    * A few pairs of jeans, t-shirts, and formal/semi-formal outfits.
    * One good quality waterproof and insulated winter jacket. (You can also buy one here from brands like Columbia or The North Face, but they can be expensive).
    * Thermal wear, sweaters, gloves, a warm cap, and a scarf.
    * Good waterproof snow boots are essential. You'll thank us in January!
    * Some traditional Indian ethnic wear for festivals and cultural events.
* [ ] **Kitchen Essentials from Home (Optional but Recommended):**
    * A pressure cooker (3-5 litres is a popular choice). Don't forget extra gaskets and safety valves. You *can* buy these here at Indian stores or on Amazon, but having your own is convenient.
    * Basic spices in a *masala dabba*. Pack them well to avoid spills!
    * Maybe a *belan* (rolling pin) or a *tawa* if you can't live without perfect rotis.
* [ ] **Other Items:**
    * Bedsheets and a pillow cover for the first few nights.
    * Basic toiletries to last the first week.
    * Extra pairs of spectacles or a supply of contact lenses.
    * A small umbrella.

**What NOT to Pack:**
* **Textbooks:** They are heavy and you can buy/rent them here or find digital versions.
* **Too much food:** Avoid bringing large quantities of rice, flour, or lentils. You can find everything at Indian grocery stores here.
* **Appliances without checking voltage:** US voltage is 120V, different from India's 220V. Most Indian electronics will not work without a converter (not just an adapter).

## **Phase 3: Your First Hours in Boston - Landing at Logan Airport (BOS)**

Landing in a new country can be nerve-wracking. Here’s a step-by-step guide for navigating Boston's Logan International Airport.

**Step 1: Immigration**
After you deplane, you'll be guided to the immigration hall. Keep your passport, visa, and I-20 in your hand. The officer will ask a few simple questions like "Which university are you going to?" and "What is your major?". Just answer confidently.

**Step 2: Baggage Claim & Customs**
Collect your luggage from the carousels. An officer might ask to scan your bags. This is routine.

**Step 3: Get Connected**
The airport has free Wi-Fi ('BOSWIFI'). Connect to it to message your family and check your route.

**Step 4: Getting to Your Apartment/Dorm**
You have a few good options. **Do not accept rides from random people offering them in the terminal.** Only use official transport.

* **Ridesharing (Uber/Lyft) - The Easiest Option**
    * **How it works:** Use the Uber or Lyft app on your phone.
    * **Pickup Location:** Logan has a designated "Ride App Pickup" zone in the central parking garage. Follow the signs. You'll likely need to walk a bit with your luggage.
    * **Cost:** A ride to the Northeastern area (Roxbury, Mission Hill, Fenway) typically costs between **$40 and $60**, but this can vary a lot based on traffic and demand.
    * **Best for:** Students with a lot of luggage, arriving late at night, or who want direct, hassle-free travel to their doorstep.

* **Public Transportation (The "T") - The Cheapest Option**
    * **How it works:** The MBTA Silver Line bus (Route SL1) picks up directly from outside each terminal. **The ride *from* the airport on the Silver Line is FREE!**
    * **The Route:** The SL1 will take you to South Station. From South Station, you can connect to the Red Line subway. To get to Northeastern, you'll likely need to transfer to the Orange Line (at Downtown Crossing) or the Green Line (at Park Street).
    * **Cost:** Free from the airport to South Station. After that, a standard subway ride is about $2.40. You can buy a "CharlieTicket" or "CharlieCard" at the station.
    * **Best for:** Students with light luggage who are comfortable navigating a new public transit system and want to save money. It's a great option but can be challenging after a long flight with heavy bags.

* **Taxis**
    * **How it works:** Follow signs for the taxi stand.
    * **Cost:** Generally more expensive than Uber/Lyft. Expect to pay **$50-$70+** for the same trip.
    * **Best for:** A backup option if you can't get the apps to work.

> **Our Recommendation for First-Timers:** If you can afford it, taking an Uber or Lyft for your very first trip is often the least stressful option. You can explore the T once you've settled in.

---

## **Phase 4: Settling In - Your First Few Weeks**

* [ ] **Inform Your Family:** First things first, let them know you've arrived safely!
* [ ] **Get Your Husky Card:** This is your Northeastern ID. You'll need it for everything: building access, library, gym, meal plans, etc.
* [ ] **Check-in with OGS:** The Office of Global Services (OGS) is your main point of contact. Complete any required check-in procedures online or in person.
* [ ] **Open a US Bank Account:** See the banking section for details.
* [ ] **Get a US SIM Card:** See the mobile section for advice on plans.
* [ ] **Attend Orientation:** University and departmental orientations are crucial for understanding academic expectations and meeting people.
* [ ] **Explore Your Neighborhood:** Find the nearest grocery store (like Star Market or Target), your T stop, and walk around the campus.

## **Beyond Academics: Cultural & Campus Nuances**

This is some of the most important advice we can give. Success in the US is not just about studying hard; it's also about understanding and adapting to a new cultural and academic environment.

#### **Academic Integrity is a Very Big Deal**
* **What is Plagiarism?** In the US, using *any* words, ideas, or data from *any* source (websites, books, articles, other students' work) without giving proper credit (citation) is considered plagiarism. This is treated as a very serious offense, far more so than in many other academic systems.
* **Consequences:** Penalties can range from failing an assignment to failing a course, or even expulsion from the university.
* **Rule of Thumb:** **When in doubt, cite your source.** If you are unsure, talk to your professor *before* you submit your assignment. The university's Writing Center is an excellent resource to learn about proper citation.

#### **The American Classroom Culture**
* **Participation Matters:** Your grade may depend on speaking up in class, asking questions, and contributing to discussions. Unlike in India, being silent is often not seen as a sign of respect, but rather a lack of engagement.
* **Office Hours:** Professors have dedicated "office hours" each week for students to visit them one-on-one. Use this time! It's perfect for clarifying doubts, discussing ideas, or getting to know your professor. It is not seen as "bothering" them; it's part of their job.
* **Informal Tone:** Don't be surprised if your professors ask you to call them by their first name. The student-professor relationship is generally less hierarchical and more collaborative here.

#### **Social and Cultural Tips**
* **Direct Communication:** Americans tend to be more direct in their communication style. "Yes" usually means yes, and "no" means no. Try to be clear and direct in your own interactions.
* **Punctuality:** Being "on time" means arriving exactly at the scheduled time, or even a few minutes early. Being late for classes, appointments, or meetings is considered disrespectful.
* **Mental Health is Health:** It is completely normal to feel homesick, lonely, or overwhelmed. Northeastern has excellent resources at **University Health and Counseling Services (UHCS)**. Seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.

## **Staying Safe: Common Scams to Avoid**

International students are often targeted by scammers because they may be unfamiliar with US laws and systems. Be vigilant and skeptical.

> **Golden Rule:** No legitimate government agency (IRS, USCIS, FBI, Police) or company will EVER demand payment over the phone using gift cards, cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), or wire transfers. They will never threaten you with immediate arrest or deportation for not paying. **If you receive such a call, HANG UP IMMEDIATELY.**

Here are the most common scams:

#### **1. The Impersonation Scam**
* **How it works:** You get a call from someone claiming to be from the IRS (tax agency), USCIS (immigration), or even the police. They will sound very official and aggressive. They might say you have a problem with your visa or have an unpaid tax bill. They will threaten you with arrest or deportation if you don't pay them immediately.
* **What to do:** **HANG UP.** Do not give them any personal information or money. Report the call to NUPD (Northeastern University Police Department) and the Office of Global Services (OGS).

#### **2. The Housing Scam**
* **How it works:** You find an amazing apartment listing online (on Facebook, Craigslist, etc.). The price is too good to be true. The "landlord" says they are out of the country and can't show you the place, but asks you to wire a deposit to "secure" it.
* **What to do:** **NEVER** pay a deposit or sign a lease for a place you haven't seen in person or via a live video tour with a trusted friend. Always get your lease reviewed by **OCSS** before paying anything.

#### **3. The Employment Scam**
* **How it works:** You receive an email about a fantastic job offer with high pay and flexible hours. To get the job, you are asked to pay a fee for "background checks" or "training materials," or to provide sensitive information like your bank account details.
* **What to do:** Be suspicious of unsolicited offers. A real employer will never ask you to pay them to get a job. Check with the Northeastern Career Design office if you are unsure about a posting.

## **Deep Dive: Housing in Boston**

Housing will be one of your biggest expenses. Start your search early!

* **On-Campus vs. Off-Campus:** On-campus housing is very limited for graduate students. Most international students live off-campus. It’s cheaper and gives you more independence.
* **Popular Neighborhoods for NU Students:**
    * **Mission Hill / Roxbury Crossing / Jamaica Plain:** Very close to campus, lots of students. Can be reached by the Orange Line or Green Line (E).
    * **Fenway / Kenmore:** Close to campus, lively area, but can be more expensive.
    * **Allston / Brighton:** More affordable, popular with students from many universities. Requires a commute on the Green Line (B).
    * **Cambridge / Somerville:** Across the river, great neighborhoods but can be pricey and the commute is longer (Red Line).
* **Finding an Apartment (The Hunt):**
    * **Official NU Portal:** [NU's Off-Campus Housing Portal](https://offcampus.northeastern.edu/) is the best place to start. You can find listings and a roommate finder.
    * **Facebook Groups:** Search for groups like "Boston Housing," "Northeastern University (NU) Housing & Sublets." **BEWARE OF SCAMS!** Never pay a deposit for a place you haven't seen (or had a trusted friend see via video call).
    * **Other Sites:** Zillow, Apartments.com.
* **Key Housing Tips:**
    * **Lease Review:** Before signing ANYTHING, have your lease reviewed by **NU's Off-Campus Student Services (OCSS)**. This is a FREE service and can save you from unfair lease terms.
    * **Broker Fees:** Many Boston apartments require a "broker's fee," which can be as much as one month's rent. Try to find "no-fee" listings if possible.
    * **Safety:** Research the safety of a neighborhood before you commit.

## **Deep Dive: Money, Banking, and Mobile Plans**

* **Opening a Bank Account:**
    * **Popular Banks:** Bank of America, Santander, and Chase have branches near campus.
    * **What You'll Need:** Typically your passport, I-20, and proof of address (your lease agreement works).
    * **Pro-Tip:** Ask for a student account, which often has no monthly fees. Try to get a credit card as soon as possible (even a secured one) to start building your US credit history. This is very important for the future!
* **Mobile Plans:**
    * **Carriers:** Major carriers are AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. They offer the best coverage but can be expensive.
    * **Budget Options (MVNOs):** Companies like Mint Mobile, Ultra Mobile, and Lyca Mobile use the same networks but are much cheaper. They are very popular among students.
    * **Family Plans - The Best Hack:** The most cost-effective method is to join a "family plan." You can team up with 4-5 other students. Usually, one person with a Social Security Number (SSN) heads the plan, and everyone else pays them their share. This can bring your monthly bill down to as low as $25-$30. Ask around in the NU Sanskriti groups!

## **Deep Dive: Food & Groceries (For the Desi Soul)**

Cooking at home will save you a lot of money. Boston has great options for Indian groceries.

* **Indian Grocery Stores:**
    * **College Convenience (on Huntington Ave):** A small store right near campus. Perfect for quick, emergency needs.
    * **Shalimar Foods & Spices (Quincy):** A larger store, requires a trip on the Red Line but has a great selection.
    * **Patel Brothers (Waltham/Shrewsbury):** The largest Indian grocery chain. You'll likely need to take an Uber/Lyft or go with a friend who has a car. Worth it for bulk shopping.
* **General Groceries:**
    * **Star Market / Trader Joe's / Whole Foods:** These are the main supermarkets near campus.
    * **Target:** A one-stop shop for groceries, home goods, and more.
    * **Costco/BJs:** Membership-based warehouse stores. Great for buying in bulk if you have friends to share with.
* **Eating Out:** For days you don't want to cook, try restaurants like **Dosa Factory, Shanti, or India Quality** for a taste of home.

## **Deep Dive: Getting Around Boston**

Boston is a very walkable city with excellent public transportation, known as the **MBTA** or "the T."

* **The "T":** This includes the subway (different colored lines), buses, and commuter rail.
* **CharlieCard:** Get a plastic, reusable CharlieCard from a T station. You can load money onto it, and rides are cheaper than paying with cash or a paper ticket.
* **Student Semester Pass:** Northeastern offers a discounted semester-long T pass. You can sign up for it through your myNortheastern portal at the beginning of each semester. It's a great deal if you plan to use public transit daily.
* **Biking:** Boston is bike-friendly. You can buy a used bike or use the **Bluebikes** bike-sharing system.

---

## **The Best Part: Student Discounts & Perks!**

Your Husky Card is more than just an ID—it's a key to saving money all over Boston and online. **Always ask if a place offers a student discount!**

* **Museums & Culture:**
    * **Museum of Fine Arts (MFA):** FREE admission with your Husky Card.
    * **Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum:** FREE admission with your Husky Card.
    * **Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA):** FREE admission.
    * Many theaters, including the **American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.)** and movie theaters like **AMC and Coolidge Corner Theatre**, offer discounted student tickets or "student rush" tickets for last-minute seats.

* **Subscriptions:**
    * **Amazon Prime Student:** 6-month free trial, then 50% off.
    * **Spotify + Hulu:** Heavily discounted bundle for students.
    * **Apple Music & YouTube Premium:** Student pricing available.

    * Many clothing stores (like J.Crew, Madewell) and local cafes around campus offer a 10-15% discount if you show your student ID. It never hurts to ask!

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**Q: What is 'plagiarism' in the US and why is it taken so seriously?**
A: Plagiarism is using someone else's words or ideas without giving them credit. In the US academic system, it's considered a form of intellectual theft. The focus here is on developing your own original thoughts based on research, so showing where your source material comes from is critical. Always cite your sources to avoid serious academic penalties.

**Q: I got a scary call from someone claiming to be from the government. What should I do?**
A: **Hang up immediately.** It is 99.9% a scam. Do not engage, argue, or give any personal information. After you hang up, you can report the number to the NUPD. Remember, official agencies will communicate with you via official mail, not with threatening phone calls demanding gift cards.

**Q: How can I save money on entertainment in Boston?**
A: Use your student ID! Get free admission to the MFA and Gardner museums. Look for "student rush" tickets at theaters for cheap last-minute seats. Explore Boston's many beautiful parks, like the Boston Common and the Esplanade, which are free.

**Q: Should I *really* bring a pressure cooker from India?**
A: Many students do and are happy they did. It's convenient to have one from day one, and you're used to how it works. However, you can easily buy one here from Amazon or an Indian store like Patel Brothers. It's a personal choice, not a necessity.

**Q: How do I pay my tuition fees from India?**
A: Northeastern recommends using services like **Flywire** or **NUPay**. These platforms are designed for international tuition payments, offer competitive exchange rates, and allow you to pay in INR via methods like NEFT/RTGS. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash or using direct wire transfers from your bank, which can be more expensive and harder to track. Check the official Student Financial Services website for the most current options.

**Q: What is an SSN and do I need one?**
A: An SSN (Social Security Number) is a unique identification number issued by the US government. As an F-1 student, you are only eligible to get one if you have an on-campus job. You don't need it for most things (like opening a bank account or getting a SIM card), but it is required for employment and is very helpful for getting a standard credit card or heading a family mobile plan.
