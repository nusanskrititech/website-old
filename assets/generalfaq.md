> Due to logistical constraints and the large number of incoming students, we are unable to provide individual airport pickups. However, our pre-arrival guide provides detailed information on the best ways to get from Logan Airport to your accommodation. We also encourage you to connect with other students arriving at the same time through our WhatsApp groups to coordinate travel.
